# StartupAI Dashboard Strategy: 3-Panel OS

This plan defines the interaction model for the entire StartupAI platform, moving beyond simple data views into agentic governance.

## 1. Panel Logic
- **Left (Navigation/Scope):** No editing. Contextual selection only.
- **Main (Execution):** The active workspace. 
- **Right (Intelligence):** AI Agents, proposed writes, and strategic oversight.

## 2. Agent Catalog
1. **Analyst Agent:** Burn analysis & Financial forensics.
2. **Scout Agent:** Market comps & Investor fit.
3. **Architect Agent:** Narrative flow & Pitch structure.

## 3. Workflow Logic
AI never acts invisibly. All writes follow:
Trigger -> Propose (Right) -> Approve (User) -> Execute (Main Canvas).
